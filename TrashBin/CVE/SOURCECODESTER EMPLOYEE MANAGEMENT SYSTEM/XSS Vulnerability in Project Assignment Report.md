# SOURCECODESTER EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - XSS Vulnerability in Project Assignment Report

### Title: XSS Vulnerability in Project Assignment
### Affected Component: /process/assignp.php
### CWE: TBD (Cross-Site Scripting)
### CVSS Base Score: TBD

### Summary:
The web application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within the project assignment functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "pname" parameter, which is used to assign project names. When unsuspecting users view the assigned project names, the injected script executes within their browsers, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as session hijacking or data theft.

### Proof of Concept (POC):
To exploit the XSS vulnerability, attackers craft a payload containing malicious JavaScript code and inject it into the "pname" parameter while assigning a project. For example, submitting the payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` as the project name triggers an alert box when viewed by other users. This demonstrates the successful execution of arbitrary scripts within the application.

### Remediation:
To mitigate the XSS vulnerability, the application should implement proper input validation and output encoding techniques to sanitize user-supplied data before rendering it in the application's responses. Specifically, the "pname" parameter should be sanitized to ensure that it does not contain any executable code. Additionally, implementing content security policies (CSP) and regularly auditing the application's codebase for security vulnerabilities can further enhance its resilience against XSS attacks.
